# Project Governance

This document describes the governance structure and decision-making processes for the NurOS project.

## Project Name

**NurOS** is a GNU/Linux distribution developed as an open-source community project.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Owner/BD (Benevolent Dictator)

The project leader(s) who make final decisions on project direction and disputes.

**Responsibilities:**
- Approve or reject major project decisions
- Resolve disputes and conflicts
- Enforce project rules and Code of Conduct
- Make final decisions on appeals

**Current Owner/BD:** AnmiTaliDev

**Important:** Owner/BD decisions can be appealed if you can provide strong evidence and reasoning to support your case.

### Maintainer

Component maintainers who oversee specific parts of the project.

**Responsibilities:**
- Make decisions regarding their component
- Review and merge contributions to their component
- Consult with Owner/BD when needed
- Maintain code quality and project standards

**How to become a Maintainer:**
- Apply through become.nuros.org
- Wait for vacancy announcements
- Vote by existing team members

**Inactivity policy:** If a Maintainer has no contact (not just commits, but any communication) for **3 years**, their rights are transferred to another developer.

### Core Developers

Primary development team members who work on the project regularly.

**Responsibilities:**
- Contribute code and improvements
- Participate in technical decisions
- Consult with Maintainers on component-related changes
- Can make decisions independently, but Maintainer/Owner can appeal

**How to become a Core Developer:**
- Apply through become.nuros.org
- Wait for vacancy announcements
- Vote by existing team members

### Contributors

External or staff developers who contribute to the project.

**Responsibilities:**
- Submit patches, bug fixes, and improvements
- Propose new ideas and features
- Communicate with Owner, Maintainers, and Core developers
- Follow project guidelines

**Limitations:** Contributors cannot make final decisions but are encouraged to propose ideas and discuss them with the team.

## Decision-Making Process

### Regular Decisions

Most technical decisions are made by:
1. **Maintainers** for their components
2. **Core Developers** in consultation with Maintainers
3. **Owner/BD** for project-wide matters

### Voting

When consensus cannot be reached, voting is used:

**Private voting (staff only):**
- Takes place in the private Telegram group
- Only staff developers (Owner, Maintainers, Core developers) can vote
- **Simple majority** (50% + 1) required to pass

**Public voting:**
- Takes place in Telegram channel @nuros_tg
- Any community member can participate
- Used for community-wide discussions and non-binding polls

### Appeals Process

Owner/BD decisions can be appealed if you disagree:

**How to appeal:**
1. Contact Owner/BD directly through their GitHub profile (email or other contacts listed there)
2. Appeals can be made publicly or privately
3. **You must provide evidence and reasoning** - not just disagreement
4. Owner/BD will reconsider based on the evidence presented

**Note:** There is no fixed timeline for appeal resolution. Be patient and provide complete information.

## Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise between developers:

1. **Debate** - Discuss in project chats (public or private staff chat)
2. **Present evidence** - Support your position with facts and reasoning
3. **Seek consensus** - Try to find middle ground
4. **Vote** - If consensus fails, use voting process above
5. **Owner decision** - As final resort, Owner/BD makes the call

**Preferred approach:** Public discussion in community chats when possible, private staff discussions when sensitive.

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

The project follows **Contributor Covenant 3.0 Code of Conduct**.

**Violations are handled by:**
- Owner/BD makes final decisions on CoC violations
- See ENFORCEMENT.md for specific procedures

## Transparency

The project values openness:
- Major decisions should be documented
- Community should be informed of important changes
- Voting results (when applicable) should be shared
- Financial matters are documented in DONATIONS.md

## Changes to Governance

This governance document can be modified by:
- Owner/BD decision, or
- Majority vote of staff developers in private group

Proposed changes should be discussed with the community before implementation.
